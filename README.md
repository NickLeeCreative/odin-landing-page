Landing Page Project

This is my second project for the Foundations course for the Odin Project. In it, I will attempt to code a page from scratch, using all the knowledge I have gained so far. Specifically, this page will demonstrate my understanding of CSS and Flexbox as a means to lay out and style a page.
